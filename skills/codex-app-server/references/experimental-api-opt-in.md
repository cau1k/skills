# Experimental API opt-in

Some app-server methods and fields are intentionally gated behind `experimentalApi` capability.

- Omit `capabilities` (or set `experimentalApi` to `false`) to stay on the stable API surface, and the server rejects experimental methods/fields.
- Set `capabilities.experimentalApi` to `true` to enable experimental methods and fields.

```json
{
  "method": "initialize",
  "id": 1,
  "params": {
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "my_client",
      "title": "My Client",
      "version": "0.1.0"
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "experimentalApi": true
    }
  }
}
```

If a client sends an experimental method or field without opting in, app-server rejects it with:

`<descriptor> requires experimentalApi capability`
