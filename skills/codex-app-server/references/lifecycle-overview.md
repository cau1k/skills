# Lifecycle overview

- **Initialize once per connection**: Immediately after opening a transport connection, send an `initialize` request with your client metadata, then emit `initialized`. The server rejects any request on that connection before this handshake.
- **Start (or resume) a thread**: Call `thread/start` for a new conversation, `thread/resume` to continue an existing one, or `thread/fork` to branch history into a new thread id.
- **Begin a turn**: Call `turn/start` with the target `threadId` and user input. Optional fields override model, personality, `cwd`, sandbox policy, and more.
- **Steer an active turn**: Call `turn/steer` to append user input to the currently in-flight turn without creating a new turn.
- **Stream events**: After `turn/start`, keep reading notifications on stdout: `thread/archived`, `thread/unarchived`, `item/started`, `item/completed`, `item/agentMessage/delta`, tool progress, and other updates.
- **Finish the turn**: The server emits `turn/completed` with final status when the model finishes or after a `turn/interrupt` cancellation.
